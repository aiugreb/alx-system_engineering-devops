# Outage Postmortem: Web Application Downtime

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** May 20, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 UTC

**Impact:** Our primary web application was down, resulting in users being unable to access the service. Approximately 90% of users experienced the outage, while 10% experienced significant latency issues.

**Root Cause:** A misconfigured database update script caused a cascade failure in the web applicationâ€™s backend, leading to a complete service outage.

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected by automated monitoring system (PagerDuty alert).
- **14:05 UTC:** First response by on-call engineer; initial investigation began.
- **14:15 UTC:** Assumption made that the issue was related to a recent deployment; deployment rollback initiated.
- **14:25 UTC:** Rollback unsuccessful; issue persisted.
- **14:30 UTC:** Escalated to database team as potential database issue was suspected.
- **14:45 UTC:** Database team confirmed the update script was running longer than expected.
- **15:00 UTC:** Database team started investigation on the update script; all application queries to the database were temporarily halted to prevent further issues.
- **15:30 UTC:** Misconfiguration in the script was identified.
- **15:45 UTC:** Update script corrected and re-executed.
- **16:00 UTC:** Database queries resumed, application services restarted.
- **16:30 UTC:** Full service restored and confirmed operational.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The root cause was a misconfigured database update script that was intended to optimize user data indexing. The script contained an error that caused it to run in an infinite loop under certain conditions, leading to database locks and preventing the web application from accessing required data. This resulted in the web application crashing and becoming unavailable to users.

**Resolution:** The update script was corrected by fixing the loop condition. The corrected script was tested in a staging environment to ensure no further issues. Once confirmed, the script was run in the production environment successfully. Application services were then restarted, restoring full functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**

1. **Pre-Deployment Testing:** Enhance testing protocols for database update scripts to include thorough checks for potential infinite loops and performance impacts.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement more granular monitoring of database performance metrics to detect unusual script execution times and prevent similar issues.
3. **Incident Response Training:** Conduct regular training for the incident response team to handle database-related issues more efficiently.

**Tasks:**

1. **Patch Update Script:** Review and patch the update script to ensure it functions correctly.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Implement monitoring alerts for long-running database scripts and unusual database locking patterns.
3. **Staging Environment Testing:** Develop a comprehensive testing suite for staging environments to catch potential issues before deployment.
4. **Review and Document Procedures:** Review and document incident response procedures for database-related outages.
5. **Regular Drills:** Schedule regular incident response drills focusing on database and deployment issues.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to reduce the risk of similar outages in the future and improve our overall system reliability.
